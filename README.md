# Hi there, I'm ClÃ©menitine ðŸ‘‹

I am a motivated tech student currently pursuing a degree in computer science, with a keen interest in product management and quality assurance.

My journey so far includes hands-on projects in React, Angular, Go, and C#, contributions to open-source projects, writing of specification documents, and continuous learning through courses at ALGOSUP.

I am passionate about building innovative solutions tailored to specific problems and eager to apply my skills in real-world scenarios.

You can connect with me to discuss opportunities, share insights, or even collaborate on existing projects.
